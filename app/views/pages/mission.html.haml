    %h1 Our Mission
    %p
      The mission of La Cocina is to cultivate low income food entrepreneurs as they formalize and grow their
      by providing affordable commercial kitchen space, industry-specific technical assistance and access
      to market opportunities. We focus primarily on women from communities of color and immigrant communities.

      vibrant and inclusive economic landscape.

  %h2 Breaking barriers
  %p
    The food industry has a notoriously high cost of entry: rental fees for commercial kitchen space, construction costs to open a restaurant and the packaging required to compete for shelf space at grocery stores all require significant start up capital. Burgeoning food entrepreneurs face an uphill battle for success in an overwhelming, highly-regulated, crowded and competitive marketplace.

  %p
    As a business incubator focused on working with low income people who often lack access to ownership positions in the industry, La Cocina provides a place for talented entrepreneurs to succeed. Our affordable commercial kitchen space, industry resources, access to sales opportunities and partnerships with organizations that provide capital brings down the cost of starting a business and increases the chances that an entrepreneur will be able to grow their business and achieve economic self sufficiency.

  %h2 History of La Cocina
  %hr
  %h4
    %small
      La Cocina was born out of a belief that a community of natural entrepreneurs, given the right
      resources, can create self-sufficient businesses that benefit themselves, their families, their
      community, and the whole city. The food that has come out of this kitchen since 2005 reflects
      that aspiration and, quite simply, tastes amazing.

  %p
    La Cocina (pronounced la co-see-nah, meaning “The Kitchen” in Spanish) was inspired by its current home, San
    Francisco’s Mission District. This ethnically diverse and economically vulnerable neighborhood that thrives in
    part due to the many small informal businesses that serve the community. Food lies at the heart of this community,
    and you don’t have to look far to find hidden entrepreneurs in the kitchens of many homes.
  %p
    Recognizing a need to formalize these food businesses and the opportunity created when you turn inconsistent
    and illegal home restaurants into sustainable legal businesses, organizations like Arriba Juntos, The Women’s
    Initiative for Self-Employment and The Women’s Foundation of California and one very special and visionary
    anonymous donor created La Cocina. La Cocina is both the space-a modern building and commercial kitchen
    that has been featured in Metropolis Magazine—and the program—an innovative business incubator that supports
    a growing roster of small businesses.

  %p
    La Cocina is a home for 30 up-and-coming businesses and a growing roster of graduates, representing all aspects
    of local food. As a result of these businesses and La Cocina’s support, community jobs have been created
    and thousands have been introduced to the flavors of the world. As a testament to their quality, the businesses
    of La Cocina sell their products locally, regionally, nationally, and even internationally.
